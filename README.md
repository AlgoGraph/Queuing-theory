## Tasks
- AE:
    - eval validations:
        - the "//" in eval
          - possible solution:
              - regex to detect it and replace all of them by one
        - eval doesn't handle zeros on the left > ex. "03"
    - Visualization refactoring  
    - for DD1k when lambda and mu are entered > check if lambda > mu and disable M ^_^
